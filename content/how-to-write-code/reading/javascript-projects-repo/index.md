This textbook will often reference the `javascript-projects` git repository as you are working your way through. This repository contains code for most, but not all code snippets, exercises, and studios throught the book. However, it does *not* contain any graded assignments.

The `javascript-projects` git repository is located in GitWeb. Before moving on to the next section you will need to `clone` the repository. You have already completed this process once already. For a refresher on locating and cloning git repositories please revisit [this section]({{% relref "../../../content/how-programs-work/reading/your-first-program/index.md#go-to-gitweb" %}})

Once you have completed the above steps you are ready to move on!
