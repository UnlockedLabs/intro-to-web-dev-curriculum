## Validating  Node Installation

We will need `Node.js` to run JavaScript code in our IDE.

1. Open a new terminal window.
1. Type the command, `node -v`, in the terminal.
1. If the output includes a Node version, similar to the code below, then you are ready to use Node!

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   
   **Console Output**
   
   ```console
   v23.7.0
   ```

1. If the output does not include a Node version, consult with your TA.
