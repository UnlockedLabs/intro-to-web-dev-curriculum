## Validating Visual Studio Code Installation

Before we start coding on our computer, we need to make sure we have the right tools! Programmers use **integrated development environments (IDE)** to write and run their code. The development environment we will be using for this class is Visual Studio Code.

In addition to simply writing and running code, Visual Studio Code has tools that recognize errors in our code and has an integrated terminal so we can navigate through our filesystem to find the files that need our attention.

Visual Studio Code is very customizable. Once you have everything set up, you can take additional steps to personalize your workspace such as changing the theme.

Open Visual Studio Code. To open one of your coding projects, go to _File > Open Folder_ and select the project you want to work on.

To start working with the terminal, look for the _Terminal_ tab in the top menu.  To open at new terminal,  _Terminal > New Terminal_. The new terminal window will open on the bottom of your IDE.
