## Validating Git Installation

Git will help us track changes and versions of our code.


1. Open a new terminal window.
1. Type the command, `git --version`, in the terminal.
1. If the output includes a Git version, similar to the code below, then you are ready to use Git!

   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   
   **Console Output**
   
   ```console
   git version 2.39.5
   ```

1. If the output does not include a Git version, consult with your TA.
