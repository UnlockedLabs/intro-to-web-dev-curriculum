There are sections in this curriculum that require you to have access to the internet which you don't have as an offline student. We didn't want to remove these sections because they illustrate how developers set up their programming environments with the internet. This page seeks to explain how the online curriculum was converted to run offline.

## npm install

If you are working as an offline student, you do not need to run the `npm install` or `npm i` command (it won't work even if you try).  Since you do not have access to the internet, an online developer ran the `npm install` command for you and included the downloaded modules for you to use.
