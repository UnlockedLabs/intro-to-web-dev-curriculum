Before you can start coding, you need to be familiar with the coding tools you will be using.  

The following software applications (coding tools) have already been installed and configured, ready for your use.

## Visual Studio Code 

For this course, you will be working in a **integrated development environment (IDE)** called Visual Studio Code.  

This is where you will write and run your code.

We have created a Visual Studio Code [installation guide]({{% relref "../../../installations/install-visual-studio/_index.md" %}}) for you to follow.

## The Terminal

We will be using the terminal to keep track of our code.

This tool is used for giving commands to your code to run or start.  This tool is also used to help track the status of your code as you work on it.  We will learn about it more in later chapters.

We have created a Terminal [installation guide]({{% relref "../../../installations/terminal-setup/_index.md" %}}) for you to follow.

## Node.js

`Node.js` is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers execute JavaScript code outside a web browser. You will use `Node.js` commands to run, build, and test your JavaScript code as you work through this course.

We have created a `Node.js` [installation guide]({{% relref "../../../installations/install-node/_index.md" %}}) for you to follow.

## Git

Git is a version control tool, or a way to track and manage changes in your code.  We will explore it more later in this course.  In the next section of this chapter, you will learn the basic git commands needed to work with the codebases in this course.

Much of the **starter code** for this course is stored in git 'repositories', or 'repos'.  A repository is just a place to keep code (offline or online), where multiple people can see and edit it.  Starter code is usually code that is lacking functionality or a complete solution.  We often provide stater code for examples, exercises, studios, and graded assignments. You will work on completing the code as you work through this course.

Your TA will provide you with the credentials (username and password) that you will be using to access the git repos.

We have created a Git [installation guide]({{% relref "../../../installations/install-git/_index.md" %}}) for you to follow.

And with that, you are ready to start coding your first program.
