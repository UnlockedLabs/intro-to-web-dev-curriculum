We use unit tests in your graded assignments to provide feedback on your progress. We will refer to them as auto-graded or auto-grading tests in these projects. Use the tests to check your work as you complete the assignment. The goal is to pass all tests.

## Using the Terminal

Testing in the terminal will vary by project.  Instructions are included in each Graded Assignments for running tests in the terminal.

Most Graded Assignments will use the command `npm test` to run the tests locally.  If any other instructions are needed, they will be found in the actual assignment section.
