Your first assignment is mostly an exercise in following instructions. We'll ask you to modify an existing program so that, when run, the program prints "Hello world!".

{{% notice red Warning "rocket" %}}
In order to complete this assignment there are a few things that you will need to have already completed! You can find these items below:

1. [Installed Git]({{% relref "../../../installations/install-git/" %}})
1. [Installed Visual Studio Code]({{% relref "../../../installations/install-visual-studio/" %}})
1. [Installed Node]({{% relref "../../../installations/install-node/" %}})
{{% /notice %}}

Programming jobs often require you to get familiar with, or at least make use of, additional technologies and/or processes.

So while the coding task may appear straightforward, you'll be introduced to a set of instructions, or **workflow**, that is important for the rest of your success in this class.

## Requirements

1. Change the code in Visual Studio Code.
1. Commit the code.
1. Make sure your assignment passes the test.

### Assignment Invitation
First, find `assignment0-javascript.git` in GitWeb, copy the repoâ€™s URL for cloning, and clone the project to a directory on your machine. For a refresher on locating and cloning git repositories please revisit [this section]({{% relref "../../../content/how-programs-work/reading/your-first-program/index.md#go-to-gitweb" %}})

After you have cloned the directory to your machine, open up the project within `Visual Studio Code` and move on to the next section!
