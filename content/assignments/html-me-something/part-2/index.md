For Task 2, you’ll get comfortable with using CSS selectors and rules to dictate display, while keeping your styles separate from your content.

## Getting Started
Open the file named `styles.css` in your `html-me-something/` directory.

## Getting to Work
Go ahead and start adding styles in your `styles.css` file!

### Requirements

Your CSS must:

1.  Use [margin](http://localhost:8080/devdocs_en_css_2025-01/css_logical_properties_and_values/margins_borders_padding#margin_examples) and [padding](http://localhost:8080/devdocs_en_css_2025-01/css_logical_properties_and_values/margins_borders_padding#padding_examples) to space your elements in a visually pleasing manner.

1. Use at least one of each of the following types of selectors:
   1. [element/type](http://localhost:8080/devdocs_en_css_2025-01/type_selectors)
   1. [class](http://localhost:8080/devdocs_en_css_2025-01/class_selectors)
   1. [id](http://localhost:8080/devdocs_en_css_2025-01/id_selectors)

1. Follow these rules:

   1. Use the element selector to give the `<body>` element a `margin` value of `8px` and a `display` type of `block`.
   1. Give a heading on your page the `id` of `mainHeading` and use the id selector in `styles.css` to make the color red and apply any additional styling of your choosing.
   1. Give a paragraph on your page the id of `testP` and a class name of `funParagraph`. Use the class selector in `styles.css` and make the color green and give it any additional styling of your choosing.  

   We ask that you implement the styling as requested. You will be asked to explain and point out your additional styling choices to your TA during your code review.  Have fun with creating your assignment. If any of the styling requirements do not suit your personal tastes and you want to share your work on this assignment as part of a portfolio, you can change it after the end of the unit.

### Notes
   1. In order to see any visible change, make sure to link the stylesheet to your main document.
   1. Another thing you might find useful is your browser’s developer tools.
   1. And be sure to use the _Resources_ section below as you go.

### General CSS Examples and References:¶
1. (Advanced) [Specificity (MDN)](http://localhost:8080/devdocs_en_css_2025-01/specificity)

{{% notice green "Tip" "rocket" %}} 
 Once you finish your adding your stylings, be sure to stage and `commit` your changes.
{{% /notice %}}

Now that you have applied your stylings, you are ready to test your work and submit your final project.  Move on over to [Task 3]({{% relref "../part-3/index.md" %}}) to work on these final steps.
