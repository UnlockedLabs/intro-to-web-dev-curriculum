      <description>Most people use the Internet without fully understanding how it works. Without much trouble, they can open a browser, navigate to a site, and interact with it. They do not need to know precisely how the Internet works in order to use it.
For web developers, however, fundamental understanding of the flow of information across the Internet is essential.
Servers and Clients The Internet uses the client-server model. A server is an application that provides resources&amp;mdash;such as raw data, web pages, or images.</description>

      <description>While web developers can often get away with a minimal understanding of TCP/IP and DNS, they must understand HTTP much more deeply. Before diving into the details of HTTP, let&amp;rsquo;s gain a high-level understanding.
Requests and Responses The fundamental units of HTTP are requests and responses. A client (usually a web browser) makes a request to a web server. Based on the details of the request, the server formulates and sends a response.</description>

      <description>HTTP requests must conform to the structure outlined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) . We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the most important and most commonly-used aspects of HTTP request structure.
A generic HTTP request looks like this:
GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1 Host: www.launchcode.org User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:67.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/67.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br DNT: 1 Connection: keep-alive Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Cache-Control: max-age=0 Request Body The structure has these components:</description>

      <description>Each HTTP request that reaches a web server results in an HTTP response to the client.
A generic HTTP response looks like this:
HTTP/2.0 200 OK Date: Wed, 22 May 2019 17:36:50 GMT Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 8050 Last-Modified: Wed, 22 May 2019 17:33:45 GMT &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;#34;UTF-8&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!--Rest of HTML page --&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt; The structure has these components:
Status line: The first line of the response is the response line, which contains status information about the response including the response code.</description>

      <title>HTTP in the Browser</title>

      <description>While we have covered all of the HTTP concepts you need to know at this point, it&amp;rsquo;s worth spending some time explaining how web browsers submit requests and receive responses.
Viewing Requests and Response Using Developer Tools Tip This section requires you to use Firefox&amp;rsquo;s developer tools. If you need a refresher or just a reference, visit MDN .
Open a web browser and visit some web page, say, our example from the HTML Me Something assignment .</description>
