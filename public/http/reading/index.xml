      <description>Most people use the Internet without fully understanding how it works. Without much trouble, they can open a browser, navigate to a site, and interact with it. They do not need to know precisely how the Internet works in order to use it.&#xA;For web developers, however, fundamental understanding of the flow of information across the Internet is essential.&#xA;Servers and Clients The Internet uses the client-server model. A server is an application that provides resources—such as raw data, web pages, or images. A client is an application that requests resources from a server.</description>

      <description>While web developers can often get away with a minimal understanding of TCP/IP and DNS, they must understand HTTP much more deeply. Before diving into the details of HTTP, let’s gain a high-level understanding.&#xA;Requests and Responses The fundamental units of HTTP are requests and responses. A client (usually a web browser) makes a request to a web server. Based on the details of the request, the server formulates and sends a response. The response is parsed and displayed by the browser.</description>

      <description>HTTP requests must conform to the structure outlined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) . We’ll discuss the most important and most commonly-used aspects of HTTP request structure.&#xA;A generic HTTP request looks like this:&#xA;GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1 Host: www.launchcode.org User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:67.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/67.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br DNT: 1 Connection: keep-alive Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Cache-Control: max-age=0 Request Body </description>

      <description>Each HTTP request that reaches a web server results in an HTTP response to the client.&#xA;A generic HTTP response looks like this:&#xA;HTTP/2.0 200 OK Date: Wed, 22 May 2019 17:36:50 GMT Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 8050 Last-Modified: Wed, 22 May 2019 17:33:45 GMT &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&#34;UTF-8&#34;&gt; &lt;!--Rest of HTML page --&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </description>

      <description>While we have covered all of the HTTP concepts you need to know at this point, it’s worth spending some time explaining how web browsers submit requests and receive responses.&#xA;Viewing Requests and Response Using Developer Tools Tip This section requires you to use Firefox’s developer tools. If you need a refresher or just a reference, visit MDN .</description>
