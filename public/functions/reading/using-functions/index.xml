    <title>Using Functions :: Introduction to Web Dev</title>

    <description>Having informally used and discussed functions, it is time to formalize a few concepts.&#xA;A function call is the act of using a function by referring to its name, followed by parentheses. A synonymous term is function invocation, and we will sometimes say that we are “invoking a function.”&#xA;Within parentheses, a comma-separated list of arguments may be provided when calling a function. These are sometimes called inputs, and we say that the inputs are “passed to” the function.</description>
