      <description>The following exercises walk you through the process of modifying existing components and creating new ones.
Starter Code For this set of exercises, you will need a copy of the LaunchCode React projects repository. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t done so already,
Fork the react-exercises-and-studios repository on GitHub. Clone your fork. Navigate into the exercises now:
$ pwd react-projects $ ls part1 part2 part3 $ cd part1 $ cd exercises You should be able to run npm start, but the page will not look pretty.</description>

On Pinterest, we can create boards and save pins of new recipes, wedding decor concepts, and tips and tricks for crafts. When one clicks on the pin, they are taken to a detailed view which includes a photo, a description of the pin, and in the case of recipes, ingredients one needs for that recipe.</description>
