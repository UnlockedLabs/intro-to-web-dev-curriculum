      <description>What is a Library and Why Would We Use One? Many programming languages, such as JavaScript, have libraries. A library in programming is a collection of reusable code, such as methods and classes, that developers can use to write more complex applications more efficiently.&#xA;When it comes to web-based applications, there are two very different places code can exist: in the user’s browser (front-end) and on the host’s server (back-end).</description>

      <description>Components are the building blocks of React applications. Components are reusable, independent, and are responsible from individual elements of the webpage. For example, take a look at Instacart and make note of elements of the webpage. You might see:&#xA;A button for logging into your account. A button for signing up for a new account. A section full of local to you stores so that you can select one you would like delivery from. Each store and vital information about them such as when items can be delivered by and a short byline about what the store sells. Common questions have their own section that expands when the user clicks on it to reveal the answer. Each of these elements might be a component in their React application. Components can be either functional components or class components. While there are no hard-and-fast rules on where components live in the application, best practice that we will be using in this class is placing each component in its own file and all of those files should live in a folder inside src called components. Components are then called in an App component where we would like them to appear on the page.</description>

      <description>Now that we understand more about React and components, we are ready to build a React app. To make a new React application, we will be using a front-end tool called Vite . This will allow us to scaffold a new React project with the required dependencies and launch a local dev server.&#xA;To get started we first need to install vite within the project directory.</description>

      <description>After scaffolding your React application with Vite there are a couple of things to cover in regards to the structure of the project directory and the default Vite config file.&#xA;Initial Project Structure index.html the index.html file resides within the root folder of the application. You may have worked with different tools that scaffold the index.html file into the public directory.&#xA;With Vite, the index.html is the entry point for the entire application. Lets take a look at what is inside of the index.html file below:</description>

      <description>With your application set up, you are ready to make your first component.&#xA;Creating a Component Create a directory called components within src. Inside components make a new file called Hello.jsx Write a function called Hello that does not have any parameters and returns a &lt;div&gt; that contains one &lt;p&gt; tag that just says “Hello World!”. At the front of your function declaration add export default. This will allow us to import it into other files. At this point, your Hello.jsx file should look something like this:</description>
