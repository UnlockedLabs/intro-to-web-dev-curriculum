    <title>Exceptions as Control Flow :: Introduction to Web Dev</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/exceptions/reading/exceptions-control-flow/index.html</link>
    <description>Runtime errors occur as the program runs, and they are also called exceptions. Exceptions are caused by referencing undeclared variables and invalid or unexpected data.&#xA;Control Flow The control flow of a program is the order in which the statements are executed. Normal control flow runs from top to bottom of a file. An exception breaks the normal flow and stops the program. A stopped program can no longer interact with the user. Luckily JavaScript provides a way to anticipate and handle exceptions.</description>
