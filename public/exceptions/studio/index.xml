    <title>Studio: Strategic Debugging :: Introduction to Web Dev</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/exceptions/studio/index.html</link>
    <description>Summary At this point, we have seen a lot of different types of errors. We have possibly created logic errors or syntax errors and now, we have just learned about the Error object in JavaScript. The goal of this studio is for us to develop strategies for debugging so that we can get rid of the bugs and get back to coding!&#xA;Activity Think of a bug you have seen in your code. This could be the time you dropped a keyword when initializing a variable or misused a method.</description>
