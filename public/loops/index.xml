      <description>Practice makes better. Repetition is a good thing. Repetition is a good thing. Repetition is a good thing. Repetition is a good thing.
WAIT!!! Why type &amp;ldquo;Repetition is a good thing,&amp;rdquo; four times when we can code a better result? How about printing the phrase 100 times instead?
1 2 3 for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; 100; i++){ console.log(&amp;#34;Repetition is a good thing.&amp;#34;); } Loops simplify repetitive tasks!</description>

      <description>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve launched our shuttle, let&amp;rsquo;s use loops (iteration) to automate some tasks.
Open loops/studio in javascript-projects. Before you dive in, you might notice that we have several files and folders inside. Your work will go into solution.js, but please feel free to explore the program and please don&amp;rsquo;t edit anything outside solution.js. To get started, run the command. npm install, in your terminal.
Part A: Put dinner together First, inside solution.</description>

      <description>Upon completing everything in this chapter, you should go on to the chapter on functions. If you would like to read more about loops before continuing forward, here are some of our favorite resources.
MDN Web Docs for Loops by W3Schools JavaScript Loops Explained Note The final article is from FreeCodeCamp and includes even more ways for you to write a loop in JavaScript. You do not have to master these to succeed in this course.</description>
