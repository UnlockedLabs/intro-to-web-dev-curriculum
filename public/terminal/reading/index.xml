      <description>GUIs and CLIs Most of the time when we use our computers, we do so through a graphical user interface, or GUI for short. A GUI is a system designed with icons and visual representations of the machine’s file systems.</description>

      <description>A filesystem is a structure for the computer to store the files and folders that make up the data of the operating system.&#xA;Inside a filesystem, folders are referred to as directories. Folders that exist inside other folders are called subdirectories. A root directory can refer to a few different things but essentially means the top-most directory of a given system. In other words, a root directory is not a sub-directory - but it will probably contain its own subdirectories. Inside the machine you work with, the root directory is the location of primary hard drive - in Windows, that’s your C drive; in a Mac, the root directory is represented as /. The root directory is the parent directory for the folders stored inside of it.</description>

      <description>Navigating the Terminal Window Moving from a GUI to a CLI can be difficult when we are so used to dragging our files from one folder to another. One of the difficulties is simply figuring out where we are in the filesystem! Here are some key indicators that the terminal gives us to show where we are:&#xA;LaunchCode-Super-Computer:~ lcstaffmember$This line is called the prompt. The prompt lets us know that the terminal is ready to accept commands. LaunchCode-Super-Computer is the name of the computer. The ~ tells us we are currently in the Home directory. The Home directory is the folder that contains everything in the computer. lcstaffmember is the username of the person who has logged onto the terminal. We will be typing all of our commands after the $.</description>

      <title>Running Programs in the Terminal</title>

      <description>Quickly navigating through our filesystems is just one benefit of using the terminal for programmers. We can also quickly run our code inside of the terminal to see the outputs.&#xA;The commands used to run a program in the terminal vary widely based on type of program you want to run. However, no matter what language you are coding in, the documentation will include, in some format, ways to run the program in the terminal.</description>
