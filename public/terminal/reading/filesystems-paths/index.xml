    <description>A filesystem is a structure for the computer to store the files and folders that make up the data of the operating system.&#xA;Inside a filesystem, folders are referred to as directories. Folders that exist inside other folders are called subdirectories. A root directory can refer to a few different things but essentially means the top-most directory of a given system. In other words, a root directory is not a sub-directory - but it will probably contain its own subdirectories. Inside the machine you work with, the root directory is the location of primary hard drive - in Windows, thatâ€™s your C drive; in a Mac, the root directory is represented as /. The root directory is the parent directory for the folders stored inside of it.</description>
