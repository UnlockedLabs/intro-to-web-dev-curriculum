    <description>In order to fully explain how the fetch function works, we need to define and talk about the terms asynchronous and synchronous.&#xA;Asynchronous: Not simultaneous or concurrent in time.&#xA;Synchronous: Simultaneous or concurrent in time.&#xA;When fetching data in JavaScript, the HTTP requests are asynchronous. In brief, that means when an HTTP request is sent, we donâ€™t know exactly when a response will be received by the browser. Remember that HTTP requests are sent to an address, then a response is sent. That process takes a variable amount of time depending on network speed, the address location, and response size.</description>
