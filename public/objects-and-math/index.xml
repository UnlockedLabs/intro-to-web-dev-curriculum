      <description>At our space base, it is a historic day! Five non-human animals are ready to run a space mission without our assistance! For the exercises, you will use the same five animal objects throughout.&#xA;Open up ObjectExercises.js in javascript-projects/objects-and-math/exercises to find all the starter code you will need for these exercises.&#xA;Part 1: Create More Objects Based on the two object literals provided in the starter code, create new object literals for three more animals:</description>

      <description>In the exercises, you created objects to store data about the candidates for our animal astronaut corps. For this studio, we provide you with a ready-made set of candidates.&#xA;You must create code to:&#xA;Select the crew. Perform critical mission calculations. Determine the fuel required for launch. Select the Crew To access the code for the first part, open ObjectsStudio01.js in javascript-projects/objects-and-math/studio.&#xA;Randomly Select ID Numbers Each candidate was assigned an ID number, which is stored in the candidateâ€™s data file and in the idNumbers array.</description>
