    <link>http://localhost:1313/arrays/reading/multi-dimensional-arrays/index.html</link>
    <description>Earlier we learned that arrays can store any type of value. If that is true, can we store arrays inside of arrays? Well yes we canâ€¦.&#xA;A multi-dimensional array is an array of arrays, meaning that the values inside the array are also arrays. The inner arrays can store other values such as strings, numbers, or even more arrays.&#xA;The figure below demonstrates a synonyms array that has arrays as values. The inner arrays contain words that are synonyms of each other. Notice each inner array has an index position.</description>
