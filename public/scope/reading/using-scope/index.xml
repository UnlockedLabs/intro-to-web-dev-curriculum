    <title>Using Scope :: Introduction to Web Dev</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/scope/reading/using-scope/index.html</link>
    <description>Scope allows programmers to control the flow of information through the variables in their program. Some variables you want to set as constants (like pi), which can be accessed globally. Others you want to keep secure to minimize the danger of accidental updates. For example, a variable holding someone’s username should be kept secure.&#xA;Shadowing Variable shadowing is where two variables in different scopes have the same name. The variables can then be accessed under different contexts. However, shadowing can affect the variable’s accessibility. It also causes confusion for anyone reviewing the code.</description>
