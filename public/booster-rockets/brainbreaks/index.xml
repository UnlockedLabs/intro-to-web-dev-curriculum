    <description>Step Away From Your Code Sometimes you just need to take a break. When you find yourself getting frustrated it’s time to do something else for a bit and come back with fresh eyes.&#xA;Exercise, go for a walk, do the dishes, put on some music and dance, meditate, set a timer and look up memes (bonus share them with your peers).&#xA;Does not matter what you do. By giving your brain a break, often times when you come back to the code you’ll have new insight to the problem that had frustrated you in the first place.</description>
