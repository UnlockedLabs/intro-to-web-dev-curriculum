      <description>Traits of Good Programmers
Curious. Good communicator. Creative. Detail-oriented. Persistent. Problem solver.
These are some traits that successful computer programmers share. People come to computer programming from all different walks of life and previous job experiences. But the things they have in common are that they like to solve problems. They can both imagine (or invent) the &amp;ldquo;big picture&amp;rdquo; as well as pay attention to the &amp;ldquo;little details&amp;rdquo;. They can express their ideas and listen attentively to the ideas of others.</description>

      <description>Embrace Failure Does the following statement resonate with you? If so, perfect.
&amp;ldquo;If I stumble, I WILL pick myself up, brush off the dust, and try again.&amp;rdquo;
All throughout LC101, you will be asked to code. Each exercise, studio and assignment is designed to give you experience through practice. You WILL make mistakes, and that is OK. Often, our mistakes teach us more than getting the correct answer on our first try.</description>

      <description>Attention sports fans! Embrace your favorite quote(s):
Sport Quote Baseball &amp;ldquo;There may be people who have more talent than you, but there&amp;rsquo;s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.&amp;rdquo; - Derek Jeter Basketball &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times I&amp;rsquo;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot&amp;hellip; and missed. I&amp;rsquo;ve failed over and over and over again in my life.</description>

      <description>Step Away From Your Code Sometimes you just need to take a break. When you find yourself getting frustrated it&amp;rsquo;s time to do something else for a bit and come back with fresh eyes.
Exercise, go for a walk, do the dishes, put on some music and dance, meditate, set a timer and look up memes (bonus share them with your peers).
Does not matter what you do. By giving your brain a break, often times when you come back to the code you&amp;rsquo;ll have new insight to the problem that had frustrated you in the first place.</description>
