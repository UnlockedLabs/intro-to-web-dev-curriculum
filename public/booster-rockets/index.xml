    <description>If you can’t fly then run, if you can’t run then walk, if you can’t walk then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward. — Martin Luther King Jr.&#xA;A wise programmer once told me that the reassuring thing about coding is that there is always an answer. She said that while much of life is uncertain and we’re faced with questions that don’t have definite answers, when we program we can be certain that there is an answer to whatever problem that we have. We just need to find it.</description>

      <description>Traits of Good Programmers&#xA;Curious. Good communicator. Creative. Detail-oriented. Persistent. Problem solver.&#xA;These are some traits that successful computer programmers share. People come to computer programming from all different walks of life and previous job experiences. But the things they have in common are that they like to solve problems. They can both imagine (or invent) the “big picture” as well as pay attention to the “little details”. They can express their ideas and listen attentively to the ideas of others. Finally, they are persistent–they don’t give up!</description>

      <description>Attention sports fans! Embrace your favorite quote(s):&#xA;Sport Quote Baseball “There may be people who have more talent than you, but there’s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.” - Derek Jeter Basketball “I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot… and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. That is why I succeed.” - Michael Jordan Gymnastics “I’d rather regret the risks that didn’t work out than the chances I didn’t take at all.” - Simone Biles Football “I was always willing to work. I was not the fastest or biggest player, but I was determined to be the best football player I could be on the football field, and I think I was able to accomplish that through hard work.” - Jerry Rice Soccer “The backbone of success is…hard work, determination, good planning, and perseverance.” - Mia Hamm Tennis “If I don’t get it right, I don’t stop until I do.” - Serena Williams Rocky How can you listen to this and NOT be inspired? (Gonna Fly now ) Optional Imagine your favorite motivational phrase here. - Some admired person Marathon Analogy Pretend you are not a runner (complete with the “0.0” sticker on your car), but you decide to compete in a marathon.

      <description>Step Away From Your Code Sometimes you just need to take a break. When you find yourself getting frustrated it’s time to do something else for a bit and come back with fresh eyes.&#xA;Exercise, go for a walk, do the dishes, put on some music and dance, meditate, set a timer and look up memes (bonus share them with your peers).&#xA;Does not matter what you do. By giving your brain a break, often times when you come back to the code you’ll have new insight to the problem that had frustrated you in the first place.</description>
