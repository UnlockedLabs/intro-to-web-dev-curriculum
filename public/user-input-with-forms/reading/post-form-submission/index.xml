    <title>POST Form Submission :: Introduction to Web Dev</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/user-input-with-forms/reading/post-form-submission/index.html</link>
    <description>Form Submission Using POST Instead of using GET and query parameters to submit form data, we can use POST. To submit a form using a POST request, set the formâ€™s method attribute to &#34;POST&#34;. Form data submitted via POST will be submitted in the body of the HTTP request. Data submitted by GET requests is less secure than POST because GET request URLs and the query parameters are cached and logged, possibly leaking sensitive data.</description>
