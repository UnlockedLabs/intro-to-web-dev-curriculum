      <description>When programmers make web pages, they want their pages to be beautiful, interactive, and fun. Programmers may use JavaScript to make their pages interactive, but JavaScript does not do much to define the structure and appearance of a web page. The next two chapters cover HTML and CSS, which are the two most common languages for structuring content and making it beautiful.&#xA;Before jumping in to learn HTML and CSS, we need to understand how web pages appear on screens. The process involves the browser and the server that hosts the code. You are probably very familiar with browsers as the tool that gives us access to the internet. However, programmers think of browsers a little differently. For them, the browser is what translates the code into a web page.</description>

      <description>Programmers should follow certain rules about how to structure an HTML file. The rules about how to structure an HTML file and the tags used to lay out this structure are vital to the browser being able to render the page.&#xA;Structure Rules When it comes to laying out the overarching structure of an HTML file, a programmer should follow 5 rules:&#xA;Every HTML file needs a DOCTYPE tag, specifying the HTML version used. When using the current version of HTML, the DOCTYPE tag is simple to remember as it is: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;. This is one of few tags that does not require a closing tag. The &lt;html&gt; tag denotes the beginning and end of the HTML the programmer has written. The &lt;head&gt; tag contains data about the web page. The &lt;body&gt; tag contains everything that appears on the page of the document. The &lt;title&gt; tag goes in the &lt;head&gt; of the document and browsers require it. It gives the title of the web page that appears in the tab. Here is an example of the structure of an HTML page based off of these rules:</description>

      <description>Time to dive into learning about all the different tags for creating content! This page contains a helpful table of tags to know for beginning programmers to bookmark. This is by no means an exhaustive list of all HTML tags, but it is a good place to start.&#xA;Tags to Know Tag Name Code Definition Bold &lt;b&gt; When surrounding text, makes that text bold. Emphasis &lt;em&gt; When surrounding text, makes that text italic. Hyperlink &lt;a&gt; Creates hyperlinks. Image &lt;img&gt; Denotes images. Break &lt;br&gt; A single line break. Paragraph &lt;p&gt; Creates a paragraph in text. Section &lt;span&gt; Makes a section in text. Division &lt;div&gt; Defines an area of the page. Form &lt;form&gt; Creates a form for user input. Unordered List &lt;ul&gt; Creates an unordered list. Ordered List &lt;ol&gt; Creates an ordered list. List element &lt;li&gt; Denotes an element of the list. This tag is used for both ordered and unordered lists. Table &lt;table&gt; Creates a table on the page. Heading Level One &lt;h1&gt; Creates a heading in the text. Note There are multiple headings in HTML going from h1 to h6. h1 is the top-level heading, h2 is a sub-heading of an h1, and so on. By default, the headings get progressively smaller as the heading level goes up.</description>
