      <description>Practice makes better. You will create a project that accomplishes the following:&#xA;Steps through a list of Yes/No questions. Calls functions based on the user’s responses. Rather than coding all of the functions from scratch, you are going to use existing modules to help assemble your project.&#xA;The starter code for these exercises can be found within your javascript-projects/modules/exercises directory.&#xA;Export Finished Modules Lucky you! Some of your teammates have already coded the necessary functions in the averages.js and display.js files.</description>

      <description>At this point in your learning journey, it’s normal to have doubts about your progress. This class can be challenging. In this studio, we’re spending time as a group to discuss our experiences, as well as build our confidence in our coding abilities.&#xA;Doubting progress is normal and common. Supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor, Serena Williams, Tom Hanks, and multiple CEOs have all questioned their success.&#xA;The struggle is real, and an open conversation often helps.</description>

      <description>In this chapter, we showed how to use require to pull a module into your project, and we presented two ways to use module.exports. Of course, these are not the only ways to share content.&#xA;A quick search online shows that besides functions, we can also share individual variables. There are also alternative syntaxes for module.exports - even one that exports as an object, but imports as a function (which means no dot notation).</description>
