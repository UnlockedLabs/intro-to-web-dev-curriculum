      <description>Practice makes better. You will create a project that accomplishes the following:
Steps through a list of Yes/No questions. Calls functions based on the user&amp;rsquo;s responses. Rather than coding all of the functions from scratch, you are going to use existing modules to help assemble your project.
The starter code for these exercises can be found within your javascript-projects/modules/exercises directory.
Export Finished Modules Lucky you! Some of your teammates have already coded the necessary functions in the averages.</description>

      <description>At this point in your learning journey, it&amp;rsquo;s normal to have doubts about your progress. This class can be challenging. In this studio, we&amp;rsquo;re spending time as a group to discuss our experiences, as well as build our confidence in our coding abilities.
Doubting progress is normal and common. Supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor, Serena Williams, Tom Hanks, and multiple CEOs have all questioned their success.
The struggle is real, and an open conversation often helps.</description>

      <description>In this chapter, we showed how to use require to pull a module into your project, and we presented two ways to use module.exports. Of course, these are not the only ways to share content.
A quick search online shows that besides functions, we can also share individual variables. There are also alternative syntaxes for module.exports - even one that exports as an object, but imports as a function (which means no dot notation).</description>
