      <description>“It’ll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer.” - Han Solo&#xA;Programs Given a set of inputs, Han’s computer analyzes the data and returns information about safely navigating a hyperspace jump. The computer does this by running a program.&#xA;At the most basic level, a program is a set of instructions that tell a computer or other machine what to do. These instructions consist of a set of commands, calculations, and manipulations that achieve a specific result. However, the computer cannot solve the problem on its own. Someone—a programmer—had to figure out a series of steps for the computer to follow. Also, the programmer had to write these steps in a way the computer can understand.</description>

      <description>“Computer, scan the surface for lifeforms.”&#xA;“Hey Siri, what movies are playing nearby?”&#xA;Even though today’s tech makes it seem like computers understand spoken language, the devices do not use English, Chinese, Spanish, etc. to carry out their jobs. Instead, programmers must write their instructions in a form that computers understand.&#xA;Computers operate using binary code, which consists only of 0s and 1s. For example, here is the binary version of the text Hello World:</description>

      <title>The JavaScript Language</title>

      <description>JavaScript is one of many programming languages, each of which serves different purposes. Programmers mainly use JavaScript for web development, and it is currently the most popular language that runs inside a web browser. Running inside the browser means that the code loads at the same time as a web page and can modify the content of that page. JavaScript can add or remove text, change colors, produce animations, and react to mouse and keyboard clicks. This makes the web page dynamic—it responds to user actions in real-time, and changes occur without having to refresh the page.</description>

      <description>Your First Program We are going to walk you through a very simple workflow, or sequence of steps, to start coding.&#xA;Read the Instructions Every starter code repository (repo) in this course will contain instructions. We strongly suggest you read ALL of the instructions before writing any code. This will help you understand the goal of your code and may explain any hurdles you might encounter while building your program.</description>

      <description>That was a lot. Here is a quick version of the workflow.&#xA;1. Read the Instructions 2. Open the terminal ls can list files and directories in your current location cd &lt;directory-name&gt; changes your location to the named directory mkdir &lt;directory-name&gt; creates a new directory 3. Go to GitHub Fork the repo Clone the repo to your computer 4. Open Visual Studio Code Open your new repo Open the terminal - make sure you are in your project directory Run the command: npm install Write your code Run your code often to check your progress Save your changes 5. Push up to GitHub In the terminal run the following commands: git status git add . git status - make sure you added things you wanted git commit -m &#34;with a message&#34; git push 6. Verify your changes are in your GitHub repo</description>
