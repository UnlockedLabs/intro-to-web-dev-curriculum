      <description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;ll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer.&amp;rdquo; - Han Solo
Programs Given a set of inputs, Han&amp;rsquo;s computer analyzes the data and returns information about safely navigating a hyperspace jump. The computer does this by running a program.

&amp;ldquo;Hey Siri, what movies are playing nearby?&amp;rdquo;
Even though today&amp;rsquo;s tech makes it seem like computers understand spoken language, the devices do not use English, Chinese, Spanish, etc. to carry out their jobs. Instead, programmers must write their instructions in a form that computers understand.
Computers operate using binary code, which consists only of 0s and 1s. For example, here is the binary version of the text Hello World:</description>

      <description>JavaScript is one of many programming languages, each of which serves different purposes. Programmers mainly use JavaScript for web development, and it is currently the most popular language that runs inside a web browser. Running inside the browser means that the code loads at the same time as a web page and can modify the content of that page. JavaScript can add or remove text, change colors, produce animations, and react to mouse and keyboard clicks.</description>

      <description>Before you can start coding, you need to set up your coding tools.
Be sure to create or install all of the following listed below:
Setting Up Visual Studio Code For this course, you will be working in a integrated development environment (IDE) called Visual Studio Code.
This is where you will write and run your code.
We have created a Visual Studio Code installation guide for you to follow.</description>

      <description>Your First Program We are going to walk you through a very simple workflow, or sequence of steps, to start coding.
Read the Instructions Every starter code repository (repo) in this course will contain instructions. We strongly suggest you read ALL of the instructions before writing any code. This will help you understand the goal of your code and may explain any hurdles you might encounter while building your program.</description>

Go to GitHub Fork the repo Clone the repo to your computer 4. Open Visual Studio Code Open your new repo Open the terminal - make sure you are in your project directory Run the command: npm install Write your code Run your code often to check your progress Save your changes 5.</description>
