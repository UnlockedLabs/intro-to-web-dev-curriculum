      <description>Programs may be thought of as being made up of two things:&#xA;Data Operations that manipulate data This chapter focuses primarily on the first of these two fundamental components, data.&#xA;Data can be stored in a program in a variety of ways. The most basic unit of data is a value.&#xA;A value is a specific piece of data, such as a word or a number. Some examples are 5, 5.2, and &#34;Hello, World!&#34;.</description>

      <title>Type Conversion</title>

      <description>Sometimes it is necessary to convert values from one type to another. A common example is when a program receives input from a user or a file. In this situation, numeric data may be passed to the program as strings.&#xA;JavaScript provides a few simple functions that will allow us to convert values to different data types. The functions Number and String will (attempt to) convert their arguments into types number and string, respectively. We call these type conversion functions.</description>

      <description>One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value. Recall that a value is a single, specific piece of data, such as a specific number or string. Variables allow us to store values for later use.&#xA;A useful visual analogy for how a variable works is that of a label that points to a piece of data.</description>

      <description>The previous section covered creating, evaluating, and reassigning variables. This section will cover some additional, more nuanced topics related to variables.&#xA;Creating Constants With const One of the key features of variables that we have discussed so far is their ability to change value. We can create a variable with one value, and then reassign it to another value.&#xA;let programmingLanguage = &#34;JavaScript&#34;; programmingLanguage = &#34;Python&#34;;</description>

      <title>Expressions and Evaluation</title>

      <description>An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. An expression can be thought of as a formula that is made up of multiple pieces.&#xA;The evaluation of an expression produces a value, known as the return value. We say that an expression returns a value.&#xA;Expressions need to be evaluated when the code executes in order to determine the return value, or specific piece of data that should be used. Evaluation is the process of computing the return value.</description>

      <title>Operations</title>

      <description>Operators and Operands Now that we can store data in variables, letâ€™s explore how we can generate new data from existing data.&#xA;An operator is one or more characters that represents a computation like addition, multiplication, or division. The values an operator works on are called operands.&#xA;The following are all legal JavaScript expressions whose meaning is more or less clear:&#xA;20 + 32 hour - 1 hour * 60 + minute minute / 60 5 ** 2 (5 + 9) * (15 - 7) For example, in the calculation 20 + 32, the operator is + and the operands are 20 and 32.</description>

      <description>The String Operator + So far we have only seen operators that work on operands which are of type number, but there are operators that work on other data types as well. In particular, the + operator can be used with string operands to concatenate, or join together two strings.&#xA;Example &#34;Launch&#34; + &#34;Code&#34; evaluates to &#34;LaunchCode&#34;</description>

      <title>Input with readline-sync</title>

      <description>console.log works fine for printing static (unchanging) messages to the screen. If we wanted to print a phrase greeting a specific user, then console.log(&#34;Hello, Dave.&#34;); would be OK as long as Dave is the actual user.&#xA;What if we want to greet someone else? We could change the string inside the () to be &#39;Hello, Sarah&#39; or &#39;Hello, Elastigirl&#39; or any other name we need. However, this is inefficient. Also, what if we do not know the name of the user beforehand? We need to make our code more general and able to respond to different conditions.</description>
