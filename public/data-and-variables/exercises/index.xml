    <title>Exercises: Data and Variables :: Introduction to Web Dev</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/data-and-variables/exercises/index.html</link>
    <description>Exercises appear regularly in the book. Just like the concept checks, these exercises will check your understanding of the topics in this chapter. They also provide good practice for the new skills.&#xA;We’ve included our solutions to some (but not all) of the exercises so that you can check your own work after you practice. As with any learning opportunity, take it seriously and give every exercise a fair shot before peeking at the solution. Our solution may not look exactly like yours, but that’s ok. There’s often more than one way to solve a problem with code.</description>
