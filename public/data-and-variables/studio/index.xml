    <title>Studio: Goal Setting and Getting into the Right Mindset :: Introduction to Web Dev</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/data-and-variables/studio/index.html</link>
    <description>During this studio, we will ask you to think about your mindset when it comes to facing challenges. Do challenges deter you or delight you? If challenges are something you delight in, you might have a growth mindset.&#xA;A growth mindset can be powered by one word, “yet”. The word “yet” allows us to acknowledge that we don’t know something AND that we are capable of learning it. With “yet”, the sentence “I don’t understand booleans” becomes “I don’t understand booleans yet.”</description>
