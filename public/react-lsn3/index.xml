      <description>Time to make a React app to share a hobby you love with your friends and family!
Note The solution in the react-part3-exercises-vite branch of the react-exercises-and-studios repo uses needlepoint as an example hobby. Whenever you see a reference to needlepoint in the solution to the exercises, substitute it for your own chosen hobby.
Create a new application called exercises in the part3 directory in the react-exercises-and-studios repo.
In App.jsx, remove the boilerplate content as you have done in previous lessons.</description>
