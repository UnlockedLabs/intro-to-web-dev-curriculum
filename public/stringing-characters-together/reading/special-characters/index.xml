    <title>Special Characters :: Introduction to Web Dev</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/stringing-characters-together/reading/special-characters/index.html</link>
    <description>Aside from letters, numbers, and symbols, there is another class of characters that we will occasionally use in strings, known as special characters. These characters consist of special character combinations that all begin with a \ (backslash). They allow us to include characters in strings that would be difficult or impossible to include otherwise, such as Unicode characters that are not on our keyboards, control characters, and whitespace characters.&#xA;The most commonly-used special characters are \n and \t, which are the newline and tab characters, respectively. They work as you would expect.</description>
