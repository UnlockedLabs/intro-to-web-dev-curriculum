    <description>If you had microscope powerful enough to view the data stored on a computerâ€™s hard drive, or in its memory, you would see lots of 0s and 1s. Each such 0 and 1 is known as a bit. A bit is a unit of measurement, like a meter or a pound. Collections of computer data are measured in bits; every letter, image, and pixel you interact with on a computer is represented by bits.</description>
