    <title>Bracket Notation :: Introduction to Web Dev</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/stringing-characters-together/reading/bracket-notation/index.html</link>
    <description>Understanding strings as sequential collections of characters gives us much more than just a mental model of how they are structured. JavaScript provides a rich collection of tools—including special syntax and operations—that allows us to work with strings.&#xA;Bracket notation is the special syntax that allows us to access the individual characters that make up a string. To access a character, we use the syntax someString[i], where i is the index of the character we want to access. String indices are integers representing the position of a character within a given string, and they start at 0. Thus, the first character of a string has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on.</description>
