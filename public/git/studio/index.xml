      <description>Code Together Coding together allows you to work as a team so you can build bigger projects faster.
In this studio, we will practice the common Git commands used when multiple people work on the same code base.
You and a partner will code in tag-team shifts. By the end of the studio, you should have a good idea about how two people can work on the same code at the same time.</description>

      <description>Tip As you go through these steps, you&amp;rsquo;ll be working with branches.
It&amp;rsquo;s very likely you will make changes to the code only to realize that you did so in the wrong branch. When this happens (and it happens to all of us) you can use git stash to cleanly move your changes to another branch. Read about how to do this in the chapter content.
Step 5: First Message Exchange Pilot: Use the File menu in Visual Studio Code to open the cloned communication-log-control directory.</description>
