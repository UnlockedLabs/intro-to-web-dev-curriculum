    <link>http://localhost:1313/introduction/reading/using-this-book/index.html</link>
    <description>Throughout this book, you will find a variety of different sections and practice exercises. We are writing this guide to help you make the most of the book.&#xA;Concept Checks Many pages end with a “Check Your Understanding” header. This section is full of questions for you to double check that you understand the concepts in the reading. Although your score does not count towards your final grade in the class, you should use it to help evaluate your understanding of the main concepts. After you read the chapter, you will take a quiz in Canvas that includes all of these questions.</description>
