It provides a central location to manage the flow of information, but it does not hold the actual course content. Instead, it links to the lessons you need, and it keeps a record of your completed assignments and scores.&#xA;Login to Canvas Access Canvas and the course materials at this link . To login, use your launchcode.org username and password, which are the same ones you used to apply for this class.</description>
