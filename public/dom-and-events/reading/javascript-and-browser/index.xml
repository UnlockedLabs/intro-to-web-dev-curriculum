    <description>Taking JavaScript on the Web So far, we have created web pages with HTML and CSS. These pages have been static, meaning that the page appears the same each time it loads. However, you may find that you want to create a web page that changes after itâ€™s been loaded. In order to create such a page, you would use JavaScript. Web pages that can change after loading in the browser are called dynamic. This is useful to programmers and users alike because they can interact with an application without refreshing the page. Having to constantly refresh the page would be a poor experience for the user and JavaScript helps programmers alleviate this burden.</description>
