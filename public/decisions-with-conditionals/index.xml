      <description>Attempt these exercises to test your understanding. Don’t worry if you struggle while working on them. Struggling and then reviewing the material will help you remember it.&#xA;Take note of any problem here or topic from this chapter that you don’t understand. Take a break and return to the problem. Do you see it in a new way or have a better understanding? If not, try spending five minutes researching the topic. Start with this book and if you still have questions, ask one on the internet or Slack/Discourse. You’re not the first person to learn to code and you’re definitely not the first person to ask a question or get stuck!</description>
