      <description>One of the core features of any programming language is the ability to conditionally execute a segment of code. This means that a program will run a segment of code only if a given condition is met.&#xA;Example Consider a banking application that can remind you when a bill is due. The application will notify you that a bill is due soon, but only if the bill has not already been paid.</description>

      <description>Loose Equality With == In the section booleans , we learned about the comparison operators == and !=, which test whether two values are equal or not equal, respectively. However, there are some quirks with using the == operator, which occur when we use == to compare different data types.&#xA;Example console.log(7 == &#34;7&#34;); console.log(0 == false); console.log(0 == &#39;&#39;);</description>

      <description>Recall that an operator is one or more characters that carries out an action on its operand(s). In Data and Variables we learned about three types of operators:&#xA;Arithmetic operators, such as +, -, *, /, and %. The string operator +. Compound assignment operators, such as += and -=. Arithmetic and string operators take number and string operands, respectively, returning values of the same type. Compound assignment operators work similarly with numbers or strings while also reassigning the value of the first, variable operand.</description>

      <title>Conditionals</title>

      <description>At the beginning of this chapter, we decided that we wanted to be able to write code that only executes when a given condition is true.&#xA;Again, here is our motivating example:&#xA;Example Consider a banking application that can remind you when a bill is due. The application will notify you that a bill is due soon, but only if the bill has not already been paid.</description>

      <title>Nested Conditionals</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/decisions-with-conditionals/reading/nested-conditionals/index.html</link>

      <description>We can write code with more complex branching behavior by combining conditionals and, in particular, by nesting conditionals. Let’s see how this works by tackling the following problem.&#xA;Example Write code that prints different messages based on the value of a number variable. If the number is odd, print nothing. If it is even, print “EVEN”. If it is also positive print “POSITIVE”.</description>
