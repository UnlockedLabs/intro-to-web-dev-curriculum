    <description>Loose Equality With == In the section booleans , we learned about the comparison operators == and !=, which test whether two values are equal or not equal, respectively. However, there are some quirks with using the == operator, which occur when we use == to compare different data types.&#xA;Example console.log(7 == &#34;7&#34;); console.log(0 == false); console.log(0 == &#39;&#39;);</description>
