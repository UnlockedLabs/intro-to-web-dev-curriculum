    <description>One of the core features of any programming language is the ability to conditionally execute a segment of code. This means that a program will run a segment of code only if a given condition is met.&#xA;Example Consider a banking application that can remind you when a bill is due. The application will notify you that a bill is due soon, but only if the bill has not already been paid.</description>
