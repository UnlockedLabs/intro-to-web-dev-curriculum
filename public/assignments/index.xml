      <description>We use unit tests in your graded assignments to provide feedback on your progress. We will refer to them as auto-graded or auto-grading tests in these projects. Use the tests to check your work as you complete the assignment. The goal is to pass all tests.
There are 2 ways to work with auto-grading tests:
Using GitHub Actions in GitHub Inside your terminal Using GitHub Actions Your Graded Assignment is not complete until you receive a green check mark from GitHub Actions.</description>

      <description>For your second assignment, we&amp;rsquo;ll ask you to modify and improve our Scrabble Scorer program. Did you think you were going to work on Mars Rover code already? That will come next!
We want you to update our program that asks a user for a word and outputs a score. Your final version will have three scoring algorithms and allow a user to interactively choose which algorithm to use. We&amp;rsquo;ve provided some starter code that includes the official Scrabble scoring point system and we&amp;rsquo;d like you to make some modifications to improve it.</description>

      <description>Using our knowledge of forms, the DOM, and HTTP, the commanders of our favorite space shuttle program asked us to create a quick launch checklist. We have four fields that need to be filled out with vital information: the pilot&amp;rsquo;s name, the co-pilot&amp;rsquo;s name, the fuel levels, and the mass of the cargo.
Our pilot, Chris, and the co-pilot, Blake, have been hard at work securing the cargo and filling the shuttle tank.</description>
