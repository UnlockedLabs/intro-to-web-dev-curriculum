      <description>You’ve learned a bit of HTML and some CSS, but you have likely only used it in bits and pieces so far, adding or modifying content in exercises or pre-existing files. Here, you are going to take another step forward by building an entire page from scratch. You will also get some practice using Git.&#xA;There are two parts to this exercise, one focused on HTML and another focused on CSS. HTML makes up the structure and content of web pages, while CSS dictates the visual style.</description>

      <description>Running your tests Now that you have your index.html and styles.css completed, it’s time to run the tests.&#xA;In your terminal, make sure you are inside your project directory then run npm test.&#xA;The tests are looking for the elements required. If you fail one, look for the message and apply your changes. When they all pass, stage, commit and push your changes to your repository.</description>

      <description>Next Steps: Bonus Mission! If you want to show off your hard work to all your friends, Github has a cool feature called Github Pages that makes this really easy.&#xA;Github provides free hosting for any “static” web content (like this project). All you have to do is change a setting on your GitHub repository.&#xA;In a browser, go to the Github page for your repository. Click on the Settings tab Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and enable the GitHub Pages feature by choosing your main branch from the dropdown. Hit Save. In any browser, you should now be able to visit YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/html-me-something and see your web page! Remember, Bonus Missions are always optional.</description>
