      <description>Your first assignment is mostly an exercise in following instructions. We&amp;rsquo;ll ask you to modify an existing program so that, when run, the program prints &amp;ldquo;Hello world!&amp;rdquo;.
Warning In order to complete this assignment there are a few things that you will need to have already completed! You can find these items below:
Installed Git Installed Visual Studio Code Installed Node Programming jobs often require you to get familiar with, or at least make use of, additional technologies.</description>

      <title>Task 2: Hello, World!</title>

      <description>Once you have the assignment open within Visual Studio Code, have a look around the various files and get curious about what this code does. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to look - just don&amp;rsquo;t edit any of this code just yet.
After you have done some exploring, open a terminal window within your Visual Studio Code application. You can do this by selecting the Terminal option near the top left of your window and clicking New Terminal.</description>

      <title>Task 3: Test and Commit</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/hello-world/test-and-commit/index.html</link>

      <description>Test Code Locally Run the following command to test your newly updated code to see if it passes the tests:
npm test If your tests fail, please revisit the previous section and double check that your hello.js file is formatted as expected. The test expects the output to be &amp;ldquo;Hello world!&amp;rdquo; precisely.
Commit Your Changes Now that your program prints &amp;quot;Hello world!&amp;quot; and the tests pass, you&amp;rsquo;ll commit your code. Committing your code is part of a process called version control, which we&amp;rsquo;ll get into in a later lesson.</description>
