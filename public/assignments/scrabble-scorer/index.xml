    <title>Assignment 2: Scrabble Scorer :: Introduction to Web Dev</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/scrabble-scorer/index.html</link>
    <description>For your second assignment, we’ll ask you to modify and improve our Scrabble Scorer program. Did you think you were going to work on Mars Rover code already? That will come next!&#xA;We want you to update our program that asks a user for a word and outputs a score. Your final version will have three scoring algorithms and allow a user to interactively choose which algorithm to use. We’ve provided some starter code that includes the official Scrabble scoring point system and we’d like you to make some modifications to improve it.</description>

      <title>Task 1: Initial Prompt</title>

      <description> Modify the provided initialPrompt() function to prompt the user to enter a word to score. Use the oldScrabbleScorer() function provided to score the word provided by the user. Print the result to the console. Before you move on, be sure you’re on the right track. At this point, your program should have an output like this:&#xA;$ node index Let&#39;s play some Scrabble! Enter a word to score: pineapple Points for &#39;P&#39;: 3 Points for &#39;I&#39;: 1 Points for &#39;N&#39;: 1 Points for &#39;E&#39;: 1 Points for &#39;A&#39;: 1 Points for &#39;P&#39;: 3 Points for &#39;P&#39;: 3 Points for &#39;L&#39;: 1 Points for &#39;E&#39;: 1 </description>

      <title>Task 2: Add and Organize Scoring Algorithms</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/scrabble-scorer/scoring-algorithms/index.html</link>

      <description>Your job here is to write two other scoring algorithms for the Scrabble player.&#xA;simpleScorer: Define a function that takes a word as a parameter and returns a numerical score. Each letter within the word is worth 1 point. vowelBonusScorer: Define a function that takes a word as a parameter and returns a score. Each vowel within the word is worth 3 points, and each consonant is worth 1 point. Note Make each scoring algorithm case insensitive, meaning that they should all ignore case when assigning points.</description>

      <title>Task 3: Transform Scrabble Scoring</title>

      <description>Currently, the software contains the data structure below for the traditional Scrabble scoring algorithm. Take a few moments to review how the oldPointStructure object relates a point value to a letter.&#xA;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 </description>

      <title>Task 4: Transform the Object</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/scrabble-scorer/object-transform/index.html</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/assignments/scrabble-scorer/object-transform/index.html</guid>
      <description> Write the rest of the transform() function. It will need to take an object as a parameter - specifically the oldPointStructure object. Calling transform(oldPointStructure) will return an object with lowercase letters as keys. The value for each key will be the points assigned to that letter.&#xA;Tip Recall that for...in loops iterate over the keys within an object.</description>

      <title>Task 5: Submitting Your Work</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/scrabble-scorer/submitting-your-work/index.html</link>

      <description>Before you submit your work, you should test out your code.&#xA;Test Words First run some test words with your program. Here are some words you can use to test your code:&#xA;JavaScript = 24 points using Scrabble, 10 using Simple Score, and 16 using Bonus Vowels. Scrabble = 14 points using Scrabble, 8 using Simple Score, and 12 using Bonus Vowels. Zox = 19 points using Scrabble, 3 using Simple Score, and 5 using Bonus Vowels. Example Output Review the code for each test word to see that it works as expected. Here is an example of the output you may see.</description>
