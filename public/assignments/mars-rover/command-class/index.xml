    <title>Task 2: Command Class :: Introduction to Web Dev</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/mars-rover/command-class/index.html</link>
    <description>Command Class Description We’ll follow TDD practices for the creation of Message and Rover, but for this class, Command, we’ve provided the functionality. Command is already written for you and you do not need to modify it to write passing tests. Open up and examine the file command.js.&#xA;This class builds an object with two properties: constructor(commandType, value)&#xA;commandType is a string that represents the type of command. We will go over the details of the types when we get to the Rover class and tests. At this time, note that a command type will be one of the following: MODE_CHANGE, MOVE, or STATUS_CHECK. To peek ahead at the full functionality of these types, refer to the Command Types Table . value is a value related to the type of command. Example let modeCommand = new Command(&#39;MODE_CHANGE&#39;, &#39;LOW_POWER&#39;); let moveCommand = new Command(&#39;MOVE&#39;, 12000);</description>
